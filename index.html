            <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Managing Your GEPCO Bill Online</h2>
            <p>Wondering how to begin managing your GEPCO bill online? The process is simple. Follow these easy steps to get started:</p>

            <h3>Step 1: Visit the Official GEPCO Bill Portal</h3>
            <p>The first step is to navigate to the <a href="https://gepco.netlify.app/" target="_blank">GEPCO bill portal</a>. Once you're on the homepage, you’ll see a section where you can input your billing details to access your latest bill.</p>

            <h3>Step 2: Input Your Reference Number or Consumer ID</h3>
            <p>To view your GEPCO bill, you will need either your 14-digit reference number or your 10-digit Consumer ID, both of which are listed on your previous bill. Enter this information carefully to avoid any errors.</p>

            <h3>Step 3: View Your Bill</h3>
            <p>Once you've entered the correct information, your bill will appear on the screen. You can review the total amount, the due date, and any additional charges that may apply for late payments. Take a moment to verify the information before proceeding to the payment stage.</p>

            <h3>Step 4: Pay Your Bill Online</h3>
            <p>After reviewing your bill, you can pay it directly through various online payment methods. GEPCO provides multiple options, including bank transfers, mobile wallets (JazzCash, Easypaisa), and credit/debit cards.</p>

            <h3>Step 5: Download or Print Your Bill</h3>
            <p>If you prefer to keep a record of your bill for future reference, you can download it as a PDF or print it directly from the portal. This ensures you have a hard copy for your records, should you need it later.</p>
